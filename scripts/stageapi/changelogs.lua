        TryAddChangelog("v2.0", [[- StageAPI now supports
Custom Floor Generation,
implemented via
a new LevelMap System.

- Most extra room
functionality has been
replaced by LevelMaps,
including extending base
floors with StageAPI's
DefaultLevelMap.

- Every shape of every
room type that is
used in the base
game is now preloaded
and usable in extra
rooms. Additional shapes
or types can be
requested by mods via
a function.

- Custom Grid Entities
have been overhauled.
Each CustomGridEntity in
a room is now
its own object.
This enables things
like custom effects for
Polties and
Mom's Bracelet.
Additional support
has also been added
for Dirty Mind and
Poop Gibs.

- Metadata Entities
have been overhauled.
Each Metadata Entity
in a room is now
its own object.
This simplifies searching
for Metadata Entities,
which is now done
with a single function.

- Metadata Entities can
now take advantage of
their Subtype, allowing
room editor defined
variation. For instance,
Groups can now be
given any 16-bit
integer ID.

- Added new
Metadata Entities:

-- Entered From Trigger.
Triggers the associated
group ID when the
player enters the room
near its position.
Can be used to
change the layout
of rooms depending
on which door you
enter from.

-- Shop Item Modifier.
When placed on a
pickup, turns it
into a shop item
with a specified
price.

-- Options Pickup Modifier.
When placed on
pickups, turns them
into an Options
group of a
specified ID.
You can only pick
one pickup from
the group.

-- Cancel Clear Award.
Disables the room's
clear award.

-- Set Player Position.
Sets the player's
position when the
room is entered.
Can be set to
only occur when
the room is not
yet cleared.

-- Button Trigger.
Reimplements
Event Buttons from
the base game, as
a trigger tied
to a group.

-- Boss Identifier.
When placed on a
boss, attempts to
locate the StageAPI
definition of that
boss, and convert the
boss room into a
StageAPI boss room
for that boss ID.
Mostly useful to
play the right boss
animation for extra
boss rooms or
modded bosses.

-- Room.
Custom LevelMaps can
be loaded from a
room file. The Room
Metadata Entity
indicates which room
to load and where
to put it on
the LevelMap.

-- Stage.
Allows setting the
stage of rooms on
a LevelMap room file,
when placed overlapping
a Room entity.
Alternatively, if
placed not overlapping
any entity, sets the
default stage for
ALL Room entities

- Rooms with Metadata
Entities are now
automatically taken
over by StageAPI, and
thus functional on
base game floors

the icons for
StageAPI editor
entities.

- Custom Floors now
support pre-generation
of rooms, rather than
generating each room
as you enter it,
optionally.

- Added a custom boss
pool system that
enables multiple mods
to add bosses to
the same floor via
StageAPI's pool.

- Improved entity and
grid persistence in
extra rooms significantly
