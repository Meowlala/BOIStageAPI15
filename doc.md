# Documentation

## Basic Features:

### Commands:

cstage or customstage <StageName> -- Warps to new stage.  
nstage or nextstage -- Warps to next stage.  
extraroom <ExtraRoomName> -- Warps to extra room  
extraroomexit -- Cleanly exits extra room to previous room.  
creseed -- Akin to reseed, but guaranteed to work for and only work for custom stages.  

### Classes:

`StageAPI.Class("Name", AllowMultipleInit)`: Returns a Class object, actually is one itself.

Classes can be constructed simply by calling them with (), i.e,

```
local myClass = StageAPI.Class("MyClass")
local myClassInst = myClass()
```

Classes can have a couple of functions, Init, PostInit, and InheritInit.
When called like in the example above, Init and PostInit are called, passing in whatever args.
However, you can keep going deeper, i.e,

```
local myClassInstCopy = myClassInst()
```

Which will generate another copy that inherits from myClassInst that inherits from myClass which inherits from StageAPI.Class.
In that case, InheritInit will be called instead of Init and PostInit, unless AllowMultipleInit was passed in to the initial myClass definition.

Classes are used for a majority of StageAPI objects.

## Callbacks:

`StageAPI.AddCallback(modID, id, priority, function, params...)`: Stores a function and its params in a table indexed by ID and sorted by priority, where low priority is at the start.

`StageAPI.UnregisterCallbacks(modID)`: Unregisters all mod callbacks, should be used when a mod loads, useful for luamod.

`StageAPI.CallCallbacks(id, breakOnFirstReturn, params...)`: Calls all callbacks with ID, passing in additional params. If breakOnFirstReturn is defined, breaks and returns the first non-nil return value.

`StageAPI.CallCallbacksWithParams(id, breakOnFirstReturn, matchParams, params...)`: only call callbacks matching some params, usually entity IDs. matchParams can
be a single param or a table of params. Callbacks with no param specified will be called, matching vanilla behavior. Example:

```
// Example callback: MY_POST_ENTITY_UPDATE, that can be added with a specified type, variant, subtype
StageAPI.CallCallbacksWithParams("MY_POST_ENTITY_UPDATE", true, 15, entity) // Will be called for all entities with Type == 15, and any Variant/SubType
StageAPI.CallCallbacksWithParams("MY_POST_ENTITY_UPDATE", true, {1, 2}, entity) // Will be called for all entities with Type == 1, Variant either == 1 or unspecified, and any SubType
```

`StageAPI.CallCallbacksAccumulator(id, startValue, params...)`: Calls callbacks passing an accumulator variable as the first parameter. The accumulator will be
replaced by every callback's return. So, callback 1 gets called with firstParam = startValue, returns secondValue; callback 2 gets called with firstParam = secondValue, returns thirdValue; etc.

`StageAPI.CallCallbacksAccumulatorParams(id, matchParams, startValue, params...)`: Combines the previous two.

StageAPI callbacks all use string IDs, i.e, `AddCallback("POST_CHECK_VALID_ROOM", 1, function, params)`

`StageAPI.GetCallbacks(id)`: Gets a list of callbacks from the table by the ID, sorted by priority.
It's recommended that if you use this functions you call the callbacks via one of the following functions:

`StageAPI.TryCallback(callback, params...)` and `StageAPI.TryCallbackParams(callback, matchParams, params...)`: they will try to call the callback,
and print an error if it fails. Only difference is that Params will include the matchParams in the error log, to be used when you are only calling
params for a specific entityId or similar.

`StageAPI.TryCallbackMultiReturn(callback, params...)` and `StageAPI.TryCallbackMultiReturnParams(callback, matchParams, params...)`: same as the previous
ones, but will allow returning multiple values in callback functions. They are slower, so use the previous ones for callbacks that are called many times
per frame.

You can also directly use the callback tables, but it's not recommended. Individual callbacks tables are arranged like so

```
{
    Priority = integer,
    Function = function,
    Params = {params...},
    ModID = modID,
    CallbackID = callbackID
}
```

Callback List:

- POST_CHECK_VALID_ROOM(layout, roomList, seed, shape, rtype, requireRoomType)

  - Return false to invalidate a room layout, return integer to specify new weight.

- PRE_SELECT_GRIDENTITY_LIST(GridDataList, spawnIndex)

  - Takes 1 return value. If false, cancels selecting the list. If GridData, selects it to spawn.
  - With no value, picks at random.

- PRE_SELECT_ENTITY_LIST(entityList, spawnIndex, roomMetadata)

  - Takes 3 return values, AddEntities, EntityList, StillAddRandom. If the first value is false, cancels selecting the list.
  - AddEntities and EntityList are lists of EntityData tables, described below.
  - Usually StageAPI will pick one entity from the EntityList to add to the AddEntities table at random, but that can be changed with this callback.
  - If StillAddRandom is true, StageAPI will still add a random entity from the entitylist to addentities, alongside ones you returned.

- PRE_SPAWN_ENTITY_LIST(entityList, spawnIndex, doGrids, doPersistentOnly, doAutoPersistent, avoidSpawning, persistenceData)

  - Takes 1 return value. If false, cancels spawning the entity list. If a table, uses it as the entity list. Any return value breaks out of future callbacks.
  - Every entity in the final entity list is spawned.
  - Note that this entity list contains EntityInfo tables rather than EntityData, which contain persistent room-specific data. Both detailed below.

- PRE_SPAWN_ENTITY(entityInfo, entityList, index, doGrids, doPersistentOnly, doAutoPersistent, avoidSpawning, persistenceData, shouldSpawnEntity)

  - Takes 1 return value. If false, cancels spawning the entity info. If a table, uses it as the entity info. Any return value breaks out of future callbacks.
  - Takes entity Type, Variant and SubType as callback parameters.

- POST_SPAWN_ENTITY(ent, entityInfo, entityList, index, doGrids, doPersistentOnly, doAutoPersistent, avoidSpawning, persistenceData, shouldSpawnEntity)

  - Called both by normal StageAPI room layout entity spawning, and Spawner metaentities.

- PRE_SPAWN_GRID(gridData, gridInformation, entities, gridSpawnRNG)

  - Takes 1 return value. If false, cancels spawning the grid. If a table, uses it as the grid data. Any return value breaks out of future callbacks.

- PRE_ROOMS_LIST_USE(room)

  - Called when deciding the layout of a room.
  - Return a room list table to use that instead of the default one or the room (the name of which is found in room.RoomsListName)

- PRE_ROOM_LAYOUT_CHOOSE(currentRoom, roomsList)

  - Takes 1 return value. If a table, uses it as the current room layout. Otherwise, chooses from the roomslist with seeded RNG. Breaks on first return.
  - Called both on initial room load and when continuing game, before INIT.

- POST_ROOM_INIT(currentRoom, fromSaveData, saveData)

  - Called when a room initializes. Can occur at two times, when a room is initially entered or when a room is loaded from save data. Takes no return values.

- POST_BOSS_ROOM_INIT(currentRoom, boss, bossID)

  - Called when a boss room is generated.

- POST_ROOM_LOAD(currentRoom, isFirstLoad, isExtraRoom)

  - Called when a room is loaded. Takes no return value.

- POST_CUSTOM_GRID_DESTROY(CustomGridEntity, projectile)

  - Takes CustomGridTypeName as first callback parameter, and will only run if parameter not supplied or matches current grid.
  - projectile is nil in case the grid is destroyed normally, and is set to the projectile entity in case the grid was lifted and shot as a projectile (see POST_CUSTOM_GRID_PROJECTILE_UPDATE)

- POST_CUSTOM_GRID_UNLOAD(CustomGridEntity)

  - Takes CustomGridTypeName as first callback parameter, and will only run if parameter not supplied or matches current grid.
  - Run any time a custom grid is unloaded, including via removal and via room transitions.

- POST_REMOVE_CUSTOM_GRID(CustomGridEntity, keepBaseGrid)

  - Takes CustomGridTypeName as first callback parameter, and will only run if parameter not supplied or matches current grid.
  - Run only when a custom grid is removed through the CustomGridEntity:Remove function, such as when its base grid is removed.

- POST_CUSTOM_GRID_POOP_GIB_SPAWN(CustomGridEntity, effect)

  - Can take a CustomStage as parameter to only work in that stage
  - Breaks on first returned value, see each specific callback for returned values/params (available in lua doc tags)
  - No PRE_CHANGE_DOOR_GFX as most usecases where you'd want to change door sprites are either handled by room types or Custom Doors

  - Return a number to use that MusicID as music, not running further callbacks.

- POST_SELECT_CHALLENGE_MUSIC(currentstage, musicID, isCleared, musicRNG)

  - Return a number to use that MusicID as music, not running further callbacks.

- POST_SELECT_STAGE_MUSIC(currentstage, musicID, roomType, musicRNG)

  - Return a number to use that MusicID as music, not running further callbacks.

- POST_ROOM_CLEAR()

- POST_STREAK_RENDER(streakPos, streakPlaying)

  - After rendering a streak played with StageAPI.PlayTextStreak

- POST_HUD_RENDER(isPauseMenuOpen, pauseMenuDarkPct)

  - Runs after the vanilla hud is rendered
  - Uses a workaround with the shader callback
  - Use isPauseMenuOpen and pauseMenuDarkPct to work around the pause menu, as
    the things rendered now will render over that too; either disable
    them or darken them.
  - Handy constant: StageAPI.PAUSE_DARK_BG_COLOR, the color of the dark background
    rendered above the hud normally when paused

- PRE_LEVELMAP_SPAWN_DOOR(slot, doorData, levelRoom, targetLevelRoom, roomData, levelMap)

  - When a LevelMap has AutoDoors set, it automatically places doors based on room types
  - This callback runs before it places a door, allowing you to change it.
  - doorData is a table {ExitRoom = LevelMapRoomID, ExitSlot = slot}

- EARLY_NEW_ROOM()

  - Runs on the first PRE_ROOM_ENTITY_SPAWN in a room
  - Note that this means it will NOT run in empty rooms, and thus cannot be relied upon in all cases
