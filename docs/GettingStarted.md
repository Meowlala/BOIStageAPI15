## Introduction

StageAPI is a powerful library for [*The Binding of Isaac: Repentance*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/) that allows for the creation of custom stages. It also provides other functionality that the modding API does not support, such as adding bosses and custom room types.

## Installation

**Steam Users:** If you own *The Binding of Isaac: Repentance* on Steam, you can install StageAPI off of the workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1348031964).

**Non-Steam Users:** If you do not own the game on Steam, can clone the repository into your mods folder. Please keep in mind that certain features in the repository might not be present in the public build available on the Steam Workshop.
